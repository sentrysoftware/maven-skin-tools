<p>This section explains how to configure the main properties of the PATROL Agent from the <b>Agent</b> menu of the <b>skin-test</b> user interface. Detailed information about the PATROL Agent properties itself is available from the BMC Documentation, see the <a href="#Related_Topics">Related Topic</a> section.</p>

<p><b>skin-test</b> allows you to manage the main configuration properties of the PATROL Agent directly from its Web interface, that is:</p>
<ul>

<li>Defining a default user account</li>
<li>Managing user access rights</li>
<li>Preloading KMs</li>
<li>Configuring data retention periods</li>
<li>Managing TrueSight Integration properties</li>
<li>Configuring advanced settings</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the PATROL Agent is properly configured, you need to review and customize the settings for:</p>
<ul>

<li>Java</li>
<li>HTTP server</li>
</ul><section>
<h2><a name="Defining_a_Default_User_Account"></a>Defining a Default User Account</h2>
<p>You can configure the <b>Default Account</b> that the agent uses for parameter collects, recovery actions, and discovery procedures. By default, this account is the one used to install the PATROL Agent.</p>
<p>On Windows systems, if the <b>Run As LOCALSYSTEM</b> option is activated, the PATROL Agent uses the <i>LocalSystem</i> account, that is the predefined account on the server running the PATROL Agent which grants extensive privileges. This account does not have a password.</p></section><section>
<h2><a name="Managing_User_Access_Rights_.28Access_Control_List.29"></a>Managing User Access Rights (Access Control List)</h2>
<p>You can restrict user access to a PATROL Agent by creating an <b>Access Control List</b> (ACL) in which you can specify the allowed or denied users, hosts that are authorized or denied access to the agent and the granted access modes.</p>
<p>An Access Control List consists in a comma-separated list of entries of the following format: &lt;username&gt;/&lt;hostname&gt;/mode.</p></section><section>
<h2><a name="Preloading_KMs"></a>Preloading KMs</h2>
<p>The <b>Preloaded KMs</b> section lists all the KMs that are automatically loaded at startup by the PATROL Agent. Preloaded KMs run as long as the PATROL Agent runs.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info"><i></i><b>Tip: </b> Preload the KMs that you regularly use and for which you want to maintain a continuous data collection history.</div>

<p>If you want the PATROL Agent to only execute the KMs configured to be preloaded, set the <b>Prevent Dynamic Loading of Other KMs</b> to <b>PREVENT</b> to keep a BMC PATROL Classic Console from loading unlisted KMs.</p></section><section>
<h2><a name="Configuring_Data_Retention_Periods"></a>Configuring Data Retention Periods</h2>
<p>The <b>Parameters Retention</b> option sets the number of days that collected parameter values are retained in the history database. After this retention period has expired, the retained information is deleted.</p>
<p>The <b>Events Retention</b> option controls the maximum size in bytes of the event log. The PATROL Agent&#x2019;s local event log is a circular file, therefore, when the file fills up, the agent deletes older events to accommodate new ones.</p></section><section>
<h2><a name="Managing_TrueSight_Integration_Properties"></a>Managing TrueSight Integration Properties</h2>
<p>This section describes how you can add Integration Services to Infrastructure Management Servers and manage their properties.</p><section>
<h3><a name="Specifying_the_Integration_Service_Path"></a>Specifying the Integration Service Path</h3>
<p>An Integration Service string needs to be provided to initiate the PATROL Agent connection to the <b>Integration Service</b>. You can specify multiple Integration Service by using a comma as a separator between the Integration Service strings. If the PATROL Agent fails to connect to the first Integration Service, then it uses the next one.</p></section><section>
<h3><a name="Defining_Tags"></a>Defining Tags</h3>
<p>You can assign a <b>Tag</b> to PATROL Agents to easily apply a configuration to all the PATROL Agents that share the same tag. The format of each tag is tagName:tagDescription. If the tag description contains spaces, enclose the description within double quotes. You can provide multiple tags separated by commas.</p></section><section>
<h3><a name="Managing_Events_Routing"></a>Managing Events Routing</h3>
<p>Several options are available to define how PATROL events are routed to TrueSight Event Management:</p>

<tr class="a">

<tr class="a">
<td> <b>Route Events Through the Integration Service</b> </td>
<td> Prevents events to be sent directly to the TrueSight Event Management cell.                                                                                                                                </td></tr>
<tr class="b">
<td> <b>Send the STD/41 Event to TrueSight</b>           </td>
<td> By default, STD/41 events are not sent to TrueSight. However, some KMs, including <b>skin-test</b>, leverage this class of event to provide useful information, such as threshold breaches, for example.</td></tr>

<h3><a name="Configuring_Advanced_Settings"></a>Configuring Advanced Settings</h3>
<p><b>skin-test</b> enables you to easily configure PATROL Agent key integration variables.</p>
<p>When you configure <b>skin-test</b> from the Web interface, you may want to block any updates from CMA policies that could interfere or supersede your settings. To prevent changes from CMA policies on the PATROL Agent, simply set the <b>Disable Configuration Updates from TrueSight CMA Policies</b> to <b>YES</b>.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can fine-tune the integration with BMC TrueSight with the following configuration variables:</p>
<ul>

<li>Publish Hostname</li>
<li>Integration Service Connection Timeout</li>
<li>Retries</li>
<li>Retries per Integration Services</li>
<li>Wait Before Retries</li>
<li>Text Parameter Maximum Length</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-danger"><i></i><b>Warning: </b>Most of the Agent settings require a restart of the PATROL Agent to take effect.</div>

<h2><a name="Configuring_JAVA"></a>Configuring JAVA</h2>
<p>To operate properly, <b>skin-test</b> requires that Java 1.8.00 or higher and a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) are installed on the same system that runs the PATROL Agent.</p>
<p>The <b>Java Settings</b> page displays information about the JRE currently in use and a list of all the JREs installed on the monitored system. You can also configure the following options to fine-tune the Java properties:</p>
